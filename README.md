#AutoNN

AutoNN is a research project done under Prof. Joseph Vybihal.
It is a self-learning neural network that is able to learn objects from scratch. The src folder is divided into
5 main package categories.

##Cluster

These libraries are focused on different ways of performing cluster analysis.
Descriptions for each is commented. For now, cluster2 is used in SelfLearning2 and and cluster4 is used in SelfLearning4.

##Matrix

Classic matrix libraries that perform matrix operations. Only matrix package is used; matrix2 is an idea in development.

##Network

The network packages experimented with different structures of neural networks. Things like the number of hidden layers
and scoring using threshold or highest-score operations were tested. For now, only network3 and network4 are used.

##Self Learning Networks

SelfLearning2 is the self-learning network using the centroid based method.
SelfLearning3 is the self-learning network using DBSCAN method.

##Experiments

For SL2Experiments, run Experiment and Experiment3. These correspond to Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 respectively in the paper.
For SL3Experiments, run Experiment1 and Experiment2. These correspond to Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 respectively in the paper.
